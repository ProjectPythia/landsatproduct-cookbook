This is critical for understanding model limitations, while an error map might show that a regression model performs very well in some regions but consistently fails near complex coastlines or river mouths. This insight is lost in non-spatial metrics and is vital for improving the model and correctly interpreting its outputs.","position":{"start":{"line":16,"column":1},"end":{"line":16,"column":1}},"key":"cwOurJ0Jww"}],"key":"QQuwgUlMNM"}],"key":"JUKGrbhD6d"},{"type":"block","kind":"notebook-content","children":[{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1},"end":{"line":1,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Sample Visualization Mapping Result","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1},"end":{"line":1,"column":1}},"key":"tyUyiKmp6n"}],"identifier":"sample-visualization-mapping-result","label":"Sample Visualization Mapping Result","html_id":"sample-visualization-mapping-result","implicit":true,"key":"qfbFVDJhpg"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":3,"column":1},"end":{"line":3,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"We can produce higher spatial resolution error maps if we have more validation data.

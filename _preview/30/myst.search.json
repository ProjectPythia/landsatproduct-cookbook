This might include filtering NaNs, removing physically impossible values, or masking bad pixels.\n\nTo clean the data, you typically:\n\nIdentify invalid or missing values.\n\nMask or remove unreliable data.\n\nOptionally, interpolate or fill gaps as needed.\n\n📚 \n\nTutorial: Data Cleaning with Pandas and NumPy (RealPython)\n\n🔹 Unit Conversion\n\nUnit conversion is needed when datasets use different physical units (e.g., Kelvin vs. Celsius, W/m² vs. mW/cm²) or when preparing inputs for physical equations that require standardized units.\n\nThis may also require spatial integration (e.g., converting a flux to energy) to match units over time and space.\n\n📚 \n\nPint Documentation – Units in Python\n\n🔹 Reprojection\n\nReprojection is required when datasets are provided in different coordinate reference systems (CRS). Working with mismatched projections can lead to spatial misalignment—features may not overlap or align correctly.\n\nTo reproject data:\n\nDetermine the CRS of each dataset.\n\nUse geospatial tools to transform to a common projection.\n\n📚 \n\nPyproj Documentation\n\n🔹 Regridding\n\nRegridding is used when datasets have different spatial resolutions or grid layouts and need to be brought onto a common grid. For example, satellite data may be on a swath-based grid while model output is on a regular latitude-longitude grid.\n\nThis step ensures datasets are co-located in space and is critical for any pixel-wise comparison or combination.\n\n📚 \n\nxESMF for Regridding\n\n🔹 Normalization\n\nNormalization rescales data so that it is on a consistent numerical scale, especially important when combining variables with different units or orders of magnitude as inputs to a model (e.g., temperature vs. elevation vs. reflectance).\n\nFor example, normalizing input features before passing them into a machine learning model helps ensure each variable contributes proportionally.\n\n📚 \n\nscikit-learn Preprocessing: Normalization and Scaling\n\nIn the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) workflow demonstrated in this cookbook, we will be using all of the preprocessing steps.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/preprocessing#id-preprocessing-steps","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Preprocessing data","lvl3":"Read in Landsat thermal data","lvl2":"Preprocessing"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/notebooks/preprocessing#read-in-landsat-thermal-data","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Preprocessing data","lvl3":"Read in Landsat thermal data","lvl2":"Preprocessing"},"content":"Let’s begin by reading in the data we acquired previously in the Data Access notebook.\n\nWe read in all paths and parameters\n\ncd /home/jovyan/landsatproduct-cookbook/\n\n%matplotlib widget\n\n%load_ext autoreload\n%autoreload 2\n\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport os\nimport boto3\nfrom rasterio.session import AWSSession\nimport earthaccess\nimport intake\nimport xarray as xr\nfrom shapely.geometry.polygon import Polygon\nimport geopandas as gpd\n\nimport SSTutils as stu\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n# Define the landsat STAC catalog location\nurl = 'https://landsatlook.usgs.gov/stac-server'\n\n# For atm correction\nbasepath = Path('/home/jovyan/Landsat_SST_algorithm')\nlsatpath = basepath / 'Data'\natmpath = lsatpath / 'AtmCorrection'\nmodout_path = lsatpath / 'MOD07_L2'\n\nWV = 'Water_Vapor'\n\n# For search and tile plot for Landsat\nsatellite = 'Landsat8'\ncollection = 'landsat-c2l1' #

An ML model, such as a Random Forest or Support Vector Machine (SVM), can be trained on satellite data to recognize the unique signatures of different water masses. For example, it can learn to distinguish between a warm coastal current, a cold upwelling zone, and a stable open-ocean gyre based on a combination of SST, salinity, and sea surface height data. This approach moves beyond a single temperature value to provide a qualitative understanding of the SST’s concept. It can automatically map complex features that are crucial for understanding heat transport in marine ecosystems.\n\nSpatial Analysis and Error Mapping:\n\nStandard regression metrics provide a single accuracy number for the entire study area, but they don’t reveal where the model performs well or poorly. Instead of averaging the residuals, they can be plotted at their geographic locations creating a spatial error map. Geostatistical tools can then be used to test for spatial autocorrelation, revealing if high or low errors are clustered together. This is critical for understanding model limitations, while an error map might show that a regression model performs very well in some regions but consistently fails near complex coastlines or river mouths. This insight is lost in non-spatial metrics and is vital for improving the model and correctly interpreting its outputs.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/validation-p2#advanced-methods-for-deeper-understanding","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Validation","lvl2":"Sample Visualization Mapping Result"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/notebooks/validation-p2#sample-visualization-mapping-result","position":18},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Validation","lvl2":"Sample Visualization Mapping Result"},"content":"We can produce higher spatial resolution error maps if we have more validation data.

Spatial Collocation\n\nFootprint Differences: Satellite pixels often represent an area (e.g., 1 km² or more), while in situ data may be point measurements.\n\nSolution: Use in situ data averaged over the satellite footprint or compare satellite data averaged over multiple pixels surrounding the in situ point.\n\nGeolocation Accuracy: Both satellite and in situ positions should be accurately known, especially in dynamic environments (e.g., drifting buoys).\n\nEnvironmental Variability: Spatial gradients (e.g., near coastlines or fronts) can lead to mismatches even with close locations.\n\n🔹 2. Temporal Matching\n\nTemporal Resolution: Satellites provide snapshots (sometimes daily, sometimes instantaneous), while in situ data may be continuous or periodic.\n\nSolution: Match satellite observation time as closely as possible to in situ sampling time (e.g., within ±1 hour).\n\nDiurnal Effects: Some variables (e.g., SST, radiative fluxes) vary significantly throughout the day.\n\nSolution: Use diurnal correction or only match at known overpass times (e.g., MODIS ~1:30 pm local time).\n\n🔹 3. Variable Definitions and Depths\n\nDepth Differences: For example, satellite SST represents skin temperature (top ~10–20 μm), whereas in situ sensors often measure at ~1 m.\n\nSolution: Apply a skin-to-bulk correction or compare to “foundation temperature” from models.\n\nVariable Representation: Ensure the in situ measurement is of the same quantity the satellite estimates (e.g., top-of-canopy reflectance vs. leaf-level LAI).\n\n🔹 4. Quality Control\n\nFlagging: Use only high-quality satellite and in situ data (e.g., use quality flags to exclude cloud-contaminated pixels or questionable sensor readings).\n\nConsistency in Units and Calibration: Verify that data are in the same units and reference systems (e.g., radiance vs. reflectance, SI units).\n\nError Estimates: Consider measurement uncertainty and noise in both datasets.\n\n🔹 5. Statistical Considerations\n\nMatchup Volume: A large number of matchup pairs increases robustness.\n\nBias and RMSE Analysis: Use metrics like bias, RMSE, and correlation to assess agreement.\n\nOutlier Handling: Identify and analyze outliers to understand limitations or failure modes.\n\n🔹 6. Sensor Calibration\n\nEnsure both satellite and in situ instruments are properly calibrated and traceable to standards.\n\n🔹 7. Geophysical Context\n\nGeographical Diversity: Validation should include diverse regions (e.g., open ocean, coastal, tropical, polar) to capture algorithm performance globally. In our example, we are only validating our product near Antarctica, so we should only use this product in that region.\n\nIn order to maximize the number of data matchups while still making a fair comparison, we need to determine an appropriate window in space and time.

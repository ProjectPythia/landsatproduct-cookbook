Spatial Collocation\n\nFootprint Differences: Satellite pixels often represent an area (e.g., 1 km² or more), while in situ data may be point measurements.\n\nSolution: Use in situ data averaged over the satellite footprint or compare satellite data averaged over multiple pixels surrounding the in situ point.\n\nGeolocation Accuracy: Both satellite and in situ positions should be accurately known, especially in dynamic environments (e.g., drifting buoys).\n\nEnvironmental Variability: Spatial gradients (e.g., near coastlines or fronts) can lead to mismatches even with close locations.\n\n🔹 2. Temporal Matching\n\nTemporal Resolution: Satellites provide snapshots (sometimes daily, sometimes instantaneous), while in situ data may be continuous or periodic.\n\nSolution: Match satellite observation time as closely as possible to in situ sampling time (e.g., within ±1 hour).\n\nDiurnal Effects: Some variables (e.g., SST, radiative fluxes) vary significantly throughout the day.\n\nSolution: Use diurnal correction or only match at known overpass times (e.g., MODIS ~1:30 pm local time).\n\n🔹 3. Variable Definitions and Depths\n\nDepth Differences: For example, satellite SST represents skin temperature (top ~10–20 μm), whereas in situ sensors often measure at ~1 m.\n\nSolution: Apply a skin-to-bulk correction or compare to “foundation temperature” from models.\n\nVariable Representation: Ensure the in situ measurement is of the same quantity the satellite estimates (e.g., top-of-canopy reflectance vs. leaf-level LAI).\n\n🔹 4. Quality Control\n\nFlagging: Use only high-quality satellite and in situ data (e.g., use quality flags to exclude cloud-contaminated pixels or questionable sensor readings).\n\nConsistency in Units and Calibration: Verify that data are in the same units and reference systems (e.g., radiance vs. reflectance, SI units).\n\nError Estimates: Consider measurement uncertainty and noise in both datasets.\n\n🔹 5. Statistical Considerations\n\nMatchup Volume: A large number of matchup pairs increases robustness.\n\nBias and RMSE Analysis: Use metrics like bias, RMSE, and correlation to assess agreement.\n\nOutlier Handling: Identify and analyze outliers to understand limitations or failure modes.\n\n🔹 6. Sensor Calibration\n\nEnsure both satellite and in situ instruments are properly calibrated and traceable to standards.\n\n🔹 7. Geophysical Context\n\nGeographical Diversity: Validation should include diverse regions (e.g., open ocean, coastal, tropical, polar) to capture algorithm performance globally. In our example, we are only validating our product near Antarctica, so we should only use this product in that region.\n\nIn order to maximize the number of data matchups while still making a fair comparison, we need to determine an appropriate window in space and time. In our example, we set our spatial window to 1 km and our temporal window to half of a day:dist = 1.0\ntime_add = 0.5\n\n# Landsat STAC catalog location\nurl = 'https://landsatlook.usgs.gov/stac-server'\n\n# Paths\nbasepath = Path('/home/jovyan/landsatproduct-cookbook')\nlsatpath = basepath / 'Data'\natmpath = lsatpath / 'AtmCorrection'\nmodout_path = lsatpath / 'MOD07_L2'\nSSTpath = lsatpath / 'SST/Validation/iQuamIntercomp/'\niQpath = lsatpath / 'iQuam'\n\nWV = 'Water_Vapor'\n\n# For geopandas and tile plots\nsatellite = 'Landsat8'\ncollection = 'landsat-c2l1' #
